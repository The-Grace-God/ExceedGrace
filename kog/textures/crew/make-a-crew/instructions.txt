CUSTOM CREW CREATOR

Must have:

Art Program with layers (Paint.NET and GIMP are both FREE)
Basic Knowledge of the program
Custom crew assets

1: Bottom-most layer is frame_glow.png
2: Middle layer is your custom crew member
3: Third layer is frame_metal.png

Clean up so no part of your custom crew is outside of frame_metal.png.

For added effect, apply this transformation to the crew portrait (in Paint.net ONLY, using zoom/rotate tool)
